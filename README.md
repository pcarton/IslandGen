#Description
  A small Island Generator that can make an Island with biomes based on magic and development (names only, it just more Perlin noise). Needs the [Love](love2d.org) engine for Lua.
#Requirements
  Lua and LOVE (linked above)
#Setup
  After installing LOVE, zip the files into a .zip then rename it to a .love file. You should then be able to run it as an executable. The default size takes a bit to run (1024x1024) but if you want a smaller island, change the value in the script before zip-ing (powers of 2 work best).
