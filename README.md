#Description
  Short version - make things like this!

  ![Example Island]
  (https://pcarton.github.com/images/exampleIslandGen.png)

  Long Version -
  A small Island Generator that can make an Island with biomes based on magic and development (names only, it just more Perlin noise). Needs the [Love](http://love2d.org) engine for Lua.
#Requirements
  Lua and LOVE (linked above)
#Setup
  If you have LOVE installed, you can now run that on the main directory of this project and get the same results without the zip-ing and such listed below! (This may have been a feature before, but whatever!)
##Older Setup
  After installing LOVE, zip the files into a .zip then rename it to a .love file. You should then be able to run it as an executable. The default size takes a bit to run (1024x1024) but if you want a smaller island, change the value in the script before zip-ing (powers of 2 work best).
#Examples
  Check out the media folder in the repository for some example islands.
#In Progress
  JavaScript Rewrite for experimenting in browsers.
